BDD-Security is a security testing framework that uses Behaviour Driven Development concepts to create self-verifying security specifications.

The framework is essentially a set of Cucumber-JVM features that are pre-wired with Selenium/WebDriver, [OWASP ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project), [SSLyze](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze) and [Tennable's Nessus scanner](http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-vulnerability-scanner).

It tests Web Applications and API's from an external point of view and does not require access to the target source code.
