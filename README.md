# bdd-security experimental migration to Cucumber
Current working branch for Cucumber migration, expect much brokeness while we complete the migration.

Configuration uses same concepts as the JBehave version: config.xml and the bespoke Java class file for recording selenium steps.
Tests should be run through the JUnit runners.
